My head is flooded with visions I can't escape
Ghosts of a smile that disappeared from your face last night
Subtle and difficult to explain
Spoke for a while but I could see the disdain you hide
It's burning up inside you
I couldn't decide if I'd just been lied to
Bled dry by the cuts your knife drew
What sleeps underneath those eyes
I gave a switchblade to a stone cold killer
Halloween night can decide if I live or die
Kept faith in a full blown sinner
Devil inside couldn't hide unforgiving eyes
Downed power lines on the pavement
The door's open wide to the basement
The storms in the sky let the rage in
I knew you'd embrace it
I knew that you'd take me down
The streets are covered in colors I can't forget
The decorations are sullen under the cold black night
Running from something I still regret
The words you hated could summon thunder to stoke the sky
A turn of phrase unspoken
I'll never escape from the hate you hold in
Dark shapes on a vacant ocean
Ghosts beneath the tide
I gave a switchblade to a stone cold killer
Halloween night can decide if I live or die
Kept faith in a full blown sinner
Devil inside couldn't hide unforgiving eyes
Downed power lines on the pavement
The door's open wide to the basement
The storms in the sky let the rage in
I knew you'd embrace it
I knew that you'd take me down
I should've let this go
I kept your ghost
It left me hopeless
I hope I'm swept below
This tempest grows
You can't disguise
Resentment beneath
Abysmal eyes
The depths of deceit
I gave a switchblade to a stone cold killer
Halloween night can decide if I live or die
Kept faith in a full blown sinner
Devil inside couldn't hide unforgiving eyes
